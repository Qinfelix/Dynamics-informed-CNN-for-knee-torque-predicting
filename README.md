# Dynamics informed CNN for knee torque predicting

The end-to-end CNN model for knee moment predicting is to reliable on the data quantity and quality, which performs badly when predicting a new person.

The main goal of this project is try to improve the data-driven model structure with more dynamics law integrated to improve the model performance.

The project is still in progress.
